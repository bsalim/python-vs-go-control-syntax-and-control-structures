# Python vs Go: Syntax and Control Structures

While I am brushing up Go programming language from a Pythonista perspective, I am relearning everything from zero. I documented the cheatsheet here as a side by side comparison, 
focusing on variables, control structures, functions, collections, and more.

# Python vs Go: Syntax and Control Structures

This document provides a side-by-side comparison of Python and Go, highlighting their syntax and control structures.

## Hello World

### Python
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

### Go
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

## Variables and Data Types
In Python, you declare variables and their types dynamically:

```python
x = 10
y = 3.14
name = "Budi"
is_valid = True
```

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    var x int = 10
    var y float64 = 3.14
    name := "Alice"
    isValid := true
    fmt.Println(x, y, name, isValid)
}

```

## If-Else Statement

```python

```

```go

```


## For Loop
```python

```

```go

```

## While Loop


## Switch/Case Statement



## Functions



## Lists/Slices



## Dictionaries/Maps



## Classes/Structs



## Error Handling


Enjoy and Happy Learning!
